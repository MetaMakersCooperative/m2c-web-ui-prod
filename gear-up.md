# “Gearing Up” Growth Campaign

Meta Makers Cooperative is Windsor-Essex’s only community makerspace. A makerspace is a place
where people with shared interests can gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and
knowledge. Founded as a volunteer-run non-profit cooperative in January 2019, facilitated by members &
volunteers, our mission is to provide access to tools and resources to maximize human potential. By
connecting a diverse community of makers, we bridge the gap between science, technology and the arts,
and foster innovation.

Located in Sho Studios and serving an area population of over 340,000, it’s time for us to grow! We are
upgrading our equipment in automation technology (ex. 3D printer, laser engraver, CNC mill, automated
embroidery machine), safety (ex. dust management system, saw-stop table saw, replacement power
tools), and the arts (ex. pottery & glass kiln, glasswork tools, picture-framing hand tools). As such, we will
be moving our facilities to a bigger space on the main floor!

Help make state-of-the-art technology accessible to the community by contributing to our new interactive
gear wall! Add your cog to our wall to show your support for these new resources and promote your
organization to the community.
