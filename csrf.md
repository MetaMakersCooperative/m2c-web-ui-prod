# Meta Makers Cooperative Growth and Innovation Initiative Receives CSRF Funding

**Windsor, ON** - Meta Makers Cooperative (M2C) is receiving a $60,000 grant to improve and modernize their facilities funded by the Government of Canada under the Community Services Recovery Fund (CSRF). 

“A makerspace is a community working space with tools and technologies to explore new ideas, develop key skills, collaborate, and innovate,” said cofounder Roberto Caruso. “Through this grant, we’ll make state-of-the-art technology accessible to the Windsor-Essex community.”

Meta Makers will purchase equipment in three focus areas: innovation, modernization, and the arts. 

“Imagine a high-tech innovation lab with 3D printers, a laser engraver, a CNC mill, an automated embroidery machine, and more. We selected the most-requested tools based on feedback we gathered during the pandemic. We’re making innovative technology accessible to members of the community who could not afford it otherwise,” cofounder Nik Steel said.

M2C is a non-profit cooperative run by members and volunteers, with everything they had prior to receiving the grant donated.   Some tools are outdated, and the grant will modernize their tools in a few key areas to improve air quality and safety including a state-of-the-art dust management system, saw-stop-enabled table saw, new power tools, etc.

“We cherish opportunities to collaborate with the arts community. By popular demand, we’re using this grant to build out our pottery and glasswork capabilities and to buy tools for picture-framing. We hope to support local artists and help hobbyists explore their artistic potential,” cofounder Jo Taylor explains.

Meta Makers Cooperative (M2C) is a non-profit makerspace in Windsor, launched in 2019. It is the only cooperative makerspace in the Windsor-Essex area, serving a population of over 340,000. 

“Our mission statement from the very beginning has been to provide access to tools and resources to maximize human potential.  This grant definitely helps us improve our tools so people in the community can explore new ideas, develop new skills, and innovate,” says cofounder Shawn Wilson.

Makerspace opened in 2019 on the cusp of the pandemic.  “We’re grateful to our members and all of the organizations who supported us through the pandemic. Mandates restricted our growth at a critical phase, but now that we’ve received this grant, we have rocket fuel to grow and benefit our Windsor-Essex community,” says president and cofounder Pauline Burnett.

As upgrades are installed M2C will host community open houses to share these innovations with the public. “We’re so thrilled to have this opportunity to serve the community in new and exciting ways,” director Jodi Green said.

The CSRF is funded by the Government of Canada and was delivered by United Way Centraide Windsor Essex County.
