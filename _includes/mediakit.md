## Introduction
Meta Makers Cooperative (M2C) is a non-profit [makerspace in Windsor](https://goo.gl/maps/C1DEyxi6UdCPUZfK8). Our mission is to provide access to tools and resources to maximize human potential, enabling our members to be autonomous, achieve self mastery and fulfill a sense of purpose. We also believe that science, technology, engineering, arts, and math are an integral part of the making process and when people make, they become empowered. 
We are a social enterprise with a diverse array of skilled members who help make Makers.
