    <h3>Community Make-It Series: Carve Your Own Rubber Stamp Community Class</h3>
    <p>Monday, June 5, 2023 from 7:00 to 9:00 pm</p>
    <p>In this free 2-hour workshop, Meta Makers member and printmaker Jodi Green will show you how to design, carve and print your own rubber stamp. You will learn how to carve a soft linoleum stamp block and then create a small series of test prints of your unique stamp design. We will have different types of paper for you to print on, as well as some blank cards and envelopes. The stamp is reusable, so you can take it home and use it with block printing ink or stamp pads to decorate up everything in your life!</p>
    <p>No printmaking experience is necessary. All supplies are provided and you will leave the class with at least one carved stamp and some test prints. You should come with an idea for a simple design that will fit on a 4.5 centimetre round stamp.</p>
    <p>This class is part of the Meta Makers Cooperative Community Make-It Series: a series of free-to-attend community arts classes on the first Monday of each month from June to December.  The Make-It series is funded by the City of Windsor Arts, Culture and Heritage Fund (ACHF).</p>
