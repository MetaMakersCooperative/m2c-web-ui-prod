# Meta Makers Construction Fund

Help us build a better makerspace for Windsor-Essex! We're fundraising to purchase building materials for our new facility.

## About Meta Makers

We opened Meta Makers Cooperative, Windsor's first community makerspace, in 2019.  A makerspace is a place where people can meet other makers and access tools and resources to make things.  For example, if you want to try woodworking, embroidery, pottery, or 3D printing, you could join a makerspace, make friends, and find all the tools you need to get started.

Here are a few things our members made over the past 4 years:

## Help us build a better makerspace

Over the past four years, we learned that our makerspace isn't large enough to meet the needs of makers in Windsor-Essex.  As a volunteer-based nonprofit, we don't have the funds to purchase all of the construction materials that are needed to build the makerspace that Windsor needs.  By donating to Meta Nakers, you are building a better makerspace that you could join and enjoy in many different ways:

- Try a new hobby, craft, or art, such as weaving, pottery, woodworking, or printmaking
- Meet new friends with common interests
- Learn new skills at a class or workshop
- Save money by sharing tools instead of buying your own
- Access new technologies such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines
- Use the makerspace as a venue to host classes and workshops
- Have fun at a crafting night

Over the next couple of months, we'll be framing walls, hanging drywall, painting, lighting and more to make our new makerspace a beautiful place for creativity.  We need to finish construction and move in by January 1st. Please donate to help us purchase construction materials, such as

- lumber
- drywall
- paint
- lighting

If you have any upcycled materials that you would like to donate, please contact us at info@metamakers.org 

All funds that are raised beyond our construction needs will go towards buying equipment, furnishings, and craft materials so that we can offer more to everyone who uses the makerspace.

Thank you for investing in the future of our community so that makers in Windsor-Essex have a place to flourish and make something wonderful!
